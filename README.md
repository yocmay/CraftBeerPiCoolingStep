This is a wort cooling step for CraftBeerPi.
It is basically the Mash step with revered logic: Set a kettle, temperature and duration. 
Once the temperature gets to or below the set point the timer is activated. 
Usefull for dropping the wort temperature to whirlpool hopping or chilling to yeast pitch temperature, ect., when controlling the cold water input with a solenoid valve. 

I have merely prepered the file, thanks Marco Zehnder for the rational idea.

Download and place the init. file under: craftbeerpi3\modules\plugins\Cooling
